binary-martingale
=================

This is a [Python](http://www.python.org) computer program to automatically trade binary options martingale style on  MarketsWorld.

## Installation

### Install Python and required python packages

    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Account configuration

Create a demo account and/or live account at Markets World.

Copy sample-user.py to user.py and edit the username and password for
your live and/or demo accounts.

Type `python main.py` to run the martingale trader. It will only login
to a demo account by default. To trade your live account: type `python
main.py --live'`


### Suggestion

Inquire about when the next system upgrade will be. If they halt the
trading activity in the middle of your martingale sequence, that can
be painful!

For instance, here is what they say about the upgrade:

Natalie: Hello, welcome to Markets World, how may I help you?

Terrence: hello...

Terrence: what time of the day do the programmers halt all trading activity?

Natalie: Our platform has binary trading available 24 hours 5 days a week whilst the world markets are open for trading. This is from Sunday 22:00 London (17:00 New York) to Friday at the same time.

Terrence: yes, but trading was halted yesterday.

Natalie: during 21:50 - 22:00 BST there is a 10 minute gap where all assets are close, this something occurs everyday due to how our platform was designed.

Terrence: what is "BST"? I'm in the New York time zone.

Natalie: BST means "British Summer Time"

Terrence: Is that the same at GMT?

Natalie: 22:00 BST = 17:00 EST
