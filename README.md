binary-martingale
=================

This is a [Python](http://www.python.org) computer program to automatically trade [binary options](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_option) [martingale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martingale_(betting_system)) style on MarketsWorld.

# Installation



## Install Anaconda Python

No support is provided for any other version of Python. Anaconda
Python runs on all platforms and has excellent package management.

Please
[download and install it](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/).

## Unpack this binary martingale trader somewhere

You have two options to obtain this software. If you just want to run
the software, then the simplest thing is to [download a
zipfile](https://github.com/metaperl/binary-martingale/archive/master.zip)
and unzip it.

The other option is to [install git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) and
then type `git clone git@github.com:metaperl/binary-martingale.git`
... this is a better option because it will be simpler to update. But
requires you to [install git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Install support software packages

#### Change to the binary martingale folder you just unzipped

    cd binary-martingale

#### Install the extra modules

    pip install -r requirements.txt

### Setup your login info

Copy `src\conf-example.py` to `src\conf.py` and edit it with your
login info. There are two entries there, one for your demo account and
one for your main account.

# Time to rock! Sample usages

NOTE: you must change to the `src` folder for this to work. On windows
this is:

    cd binary-martingale\src

On Linux/OS X:

    cd binary-martingale/src

or just `cd src` if you are already in the `binary-martingale` folder.


**NOTE** - there is no need to put `./` before `main.py` when invoking
  the program. That is a Linux/OS X thing.

Show the options to the program.

    [~/prg/binary-martingale/src]$ ./main.py --help

Login to your demo account (configured in conf.py) and make 1 trade.

    [~/prg/binary-martingale/src]$ ./main.py


Login to your live account (configured in conf.py) and make 1 trade.

    [~/prg/binary-martingale/src]$ ./main.py --loginas live


Issue a put trade (default is call).

    [~/prg/binary-martingale/src/]$ ./main.py --lower

Make the initial bet 4 dollars instead of the default 1 dollar.

    [~/prg/binary-martingale/src/]$ ./main.py --seed-bet 4

Aim for a profit of 2 dollars with each bet.

    [~/prg/binary-martingale/src/]$ ./main.py --step-profit 2

Assume Markets World will pay a 77% profit on a won wager.

    [~/prg/binary-martingale/src/]$ ./main.py --step-reward .77

Show the martingale sequence that will be used for betting.

    [~/prg/binary-martingale/src/]$ ./main.py --show-sequence

Round all bets to even numbers.

    [~/prg/binary-martingale/src/]$ ./main.py --round-step

Show betting sequence when you round all bets to even numbers.

    [~/prg/binary-martingale/src/]$ ./main.py --round-step --show-sequence

Engage in trading for 4 hours max (default is 5)

    [~/prg/binary-martingale/src/]$ ./main.py --max-hours 4

Engage in trading until you win 3 times (default is 1)

    [~/prg/binary-martingale/src/]$ ./main.py --sessions 3

If this is false (which it is by default), then do not trade between
2pm and 6pm EST, because MarketsWorld resets their systems at 5pm EST
and this could interrupt a series of Martingale trades.

    [~/prg/binary-martingale/src/]$ ./main.py --ignore-window
